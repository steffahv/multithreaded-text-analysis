***

This project explores the performance of a multithreaded text analysis and TF-IDF parallel calculation project in Julia, comparing it to a Python implementation. Using a dataset of 4,000 documents from the Gutenberg Project (Australia), the study evaluates throughput, tokenization speed, and TF-IDF efficiency. Results highlight Julia's superior performance and accuracy, demonstrating its effectiveness for complex text processing tasks.
